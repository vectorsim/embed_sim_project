Enhanced Simulation Engine with Feedback Loop Support
======================================================

Overview:
---------
This simulation engine extends the original EmbedSim Framework to
handle systems with **feedback loops** safely and efficiently. It provides
a framework for simulating interconnected vector-based blocks, where some
blocks have internal states (dynamic) and others are stateless (static).

Key Concepts:
-------------
1. **Blocks**:
   - Each block represents a computational unit (e.g., sum, gain, delay).
   - Blocks have inputs and outputs represented as VectorSignal objects.
   - Blocks can be **dynamic** (with internal state, integrated over time)
     or **static** (instantaneous computation).

2. **Loop Breakers**:
   - Feedback loops can create algebraic cycles that prevent topological
     ordering of computations.
   - Blocks implementing the `LoopBreaker` interface (e.g., `VectorDelay`)
     provide a previous output instead of current input for loop-breaking.
   - This ensures simulation proceeds without algebraic loops while retaining
     causal behavior.
   - **Implemented in:** `LoopBreaker` class & `VectorDelay` class.

3. **Dependency Graph Traversal**:
   - Builds a **topologically sorted execution order** from sinks to sources.
   - DFS traversal is used, but loop breakers are not recursively traversed.
   - Detects true algebraic loops and raises errors if no loop breaker exists.
   - **Implemented in:** `traverse_blocks_from_sinks_with_loops()` function.

How It Works:
-------------
Step-by-step flow of the simulation:

1. **Block Creation and Connection**
   - Create blocks (sources, processing blocks, sinks).
   - Connect outputs to inputs forming the system graph.
   - Some blocks may be dynamic (with internal states), others static.

2. **Loop Breaker Identification**
   - Engine scans for blocks implementing `LoopBreaker`.
   - Loop breakers supply previous outputs for feedback paths to prevent cycles.

3. **Execution Order Computation**
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) is used to traverse blocks from sinks backward.
   - Loop breakers are added but their inputs are not traversed recursively.
   - Produces a **topological order** for safe block computation.

4. **Simulation Loop**
   - For each timestep `t` from 0 to `T`:
       a. **Compute All Blocks**: compute outputs in topological order.
          - **Algorithm:** regular forward computation.
          - **Implemented in:** `_compute_all_blocks()` method.
       b. **Record Signals**: store outputs in `VectorScope` for later analysis.
          - **Implemented in:** `VectorScope.record()`.
       c. **Integrate Dynamics**: dynamic blocks updated using chosen ODE solver.
          - **Euler**: first-order, fast (`_integrate_dynamics_euler()`).
          - **RK4**: fourth-order accurate (`_integrate_dynamics_rk4()`).
          - **Heun**: second-order compromise (can be implemented similarly).
       d. **Progress Display**: optional progress bar.

5. **Finalization**
   - Final computation at last timestep.
   - Final recording of signals.
   - Statistics available in `SimulationStats`:
     total steps, compute time, loop breakers, feedback loops.

          (feedback path, broken by VectorDelay)

Legend:
- `[Block]`: computational block
- `VectorDelay`: loop breaker that provides previous output to break feedback
- Arrows: signal flow direction

Algorithms Summary:
-------------------
1. **Topological Sorting with Loop Breakers**
   - Algorithm: Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Implemented in: `traverse_blocks_from_sinks_with_loops()`

2. **Loop-Breaking Mechanism**
   - Provides previous output for blocks in feedback paths
   - Implemented in: `LoopBreaker.get_loop_breaking_output()`, `VectorDelay`

3. **Dynamic Block Integration**
   - Algorithms: Euler, RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4), Heun (2nd order)
   - Implemented in: `_integrate_dynamics_euler()`, `_integrate_dynamics_rk4()`

4. **Signal Recording**
   - Stores scalar or vector signals for plotting and analysis
   - Implemented in: `VectorScope.record()`

Typical Workflow:
-----------------
1. Create and connect blocks.
2. Instantiate `VectorSim` with sinks, T, dt, solver.
3. Add blocks to `scope` for recording.
4. Call `sim.run()` to simulate.
5. Use `print_topology*()` or `plot()` to visualize results.

# Loop Breaker Interface
# =========================

class LoopBreaker:
    """
    Mixin interface for blocks that break algebraic feedback loops.

    In a block diagram with feedback, a direct cycle (A → B → A) creates
    a circular dependency that prevents topological sorting.  A LoopBreaker
    resolves this by supplying its *previous* timestep output instead of
    requiring its current input to be computed first.

    Any block that participates in a feedback path should inherit from this
    class alongside VectorBlock.  The simulation engine detects LoopBreaker
    instances during graph traversal and treats their edges as "already
    resolved", effectively cutting the cycle.

    Concrete examples: VectorDelay, UnitDelay, DiscreteIntegrator.

    Attributes:
        is_loop_breaker (bool): Class-level flag; always True.  Used by the
            engine to identify loop-breaking blocks without isinstance checks
            on every graph edge.

    Usage:
        class MyDelay(VectorBlock, LoopBreaker):
            def get_loop_breaking_output(self):
                return self.last_output   # value from previous timestep

        Implementations should return the output stored from the previous
        timestep (or a user-supplied initial value at t = 0).

        Returns:

    One-timestep vector delay block that safely breaks feedback loops.

    VectorDelay outputs the signal it received in the *previous* timestep,
    making it causal and suitable for placement in any feedback path.  It

    topologically sort the graph without treating the feedback edge as a
    circular dependency.

        y(t) = u(t - dt)      for t > 0
        y(0) = initial        (user-supplied, or zero if omitted)

    Build a topologically sorted execution order for all blocks reachable

    Algorithm — two-pass DFS
    ------------------------
    Pass 1  (find_loop_breakers):
        Walk the full graph recursively from every sink.  Any block that
        implements the LoopBreaker interface is recorded in ``loop_breakers``.

    Pass 2  (dfs):
        Walk the graph again with a standard post-order DFS.  When an input
        edge points to a LoopBreaker the edge is *not* followed recursively;
        instead the loop-breaker block is inserted into the order immediately
        (it will supply its previous-timestep output at runtime).  This cuts
        feedback cycles so the DFS terminates without infinite recursion.
